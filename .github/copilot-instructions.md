When generating code, for example, a utils function, a component, or similar, we avoid using step comments or similar. The only two types of comments allowed and encouraged are:

1. Docstring comments for functions, classes, and methods.
2. Inline comments for complex or non-obvious code sections. Like mathematical calculations, regex, or similar.

Even when the file already has comments, we still avoid adding step comments or similar. We only add docstring comments and inline comments as described above. Is important to keep the code clean and easy to read. Follow the best practices for the specific programming language or framework.
